			"During my 5-month tenure as a Unity Developer, I had the opportunity to contribute to a groundbreaking project aimed at assisting individuals with low vision. Low vision, a condition not correctable by conventional means, doesn't entail complete blindness as patients retain sensitivity to light. Working with the Pico G24K E device, I played a vital role in developing features like fisheye and inline filters, grayscale and inverse grayscale modes, leveraging shaders and post-processing techniques. Additionally, I implemented zoom-in and zoom-out functionalities, brightness adjustment, and audio cues to facilitate patient engagement. This internship was both enjoyable and enlightening, providing me with invaluable knowledge and experience.",

Together, we developed a total of 10 modules, with 4 of them being my sole creations, encompassing everything from core mechanics to game implementation. I delved into various cutting-edge concepts, such as raycasting, XR-Rig, trigger and collision events, and even familiarized myself with PXR Manager and XR-input management system using Tobii initializer. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to explore the realm of 3D modeling, effectively applying those skills to enhance their projects. This experience was incredibly enjoyable and rewarding, allowing me to now integrate that knowledge into my own game development endeavors.",
